Abstract

In academic institutions across Bangladesh, students receive their semester results in the form of letter grades (A+, A, B+, etc.), which must then be manually converted into Grade Point Average (GPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). This manual calculation process is often tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error, particularly when tracking performance across multiple semesters. To address this challenge, this project presents the development of "FCUB CGPA Calculator," a comprehensive Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed for students of First Capital University of Bangladesh.

The application supports eight departments: Computer Science & Engineering (CSE), Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE), Public Health, Law, Business Administration, English, Sociology, and Agriculture. Built using modern web technologies including Vue.js 3 with Composition API, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and Vite.js, the calculator provides an intuitive and efficient solution for academic performance tracking.

Key features include semester-wise GPA calculation with course-level grade input, multi-semester CGPA computation, performance analytics with grade distribution and trends, required GPA calculator to determine what GPA is needed to achieve target CGPA, Bangladesh grading system classification (First Class with Distinction, First Class, Second Class, Third Class), data persistence using IndexedDB for offline-first functionality, department switching capability, and complete data export/import functionality for backup and device transfer.

The application implements a Progressive Web App architecture with service worker-based offline support, ensuring full functionality without internet connectivity. This makes it accessible to students even in areas with limited internet access. The tool aims to empower students to better understand and monitor their academic performance throughout their degree programs, eliminating calculation errors and providing valuable insights into their educational journey.
